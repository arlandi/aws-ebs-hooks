# aws-ebs-hooks
The default Elastic Beanstalk hooks on a fresh 64bit Amazon Linux 2016.03 v2.1.0 running Node.js. These hooks are not documented by AWS but overrideable to [fine-tune your servers](https://github.com/kopurando/better-faster-elastic-beanstalk). Use these defaults to reset if you fucked up and scaled your EBS to a million instances.
